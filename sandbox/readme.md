# README

The sandbox contains the necessary files needed to spin up sandbox environments running this image.  The sandbox implements docker-compose to easily bring up and tear down environments based on your needs.  There is no need to make commits against these objects unless there is a desire to change the way the sandbox works.  The structure provided in the sandbox is meant for you to make small configuration changes according to your environment needs.  These changes are not persisted in this repo but should be rather easy to reproduce if you need to setup another sandbox.  In most cases the defaults can be kept and no changes will be needed.  A simple docker-compose up/down can be used to bring up a full working environment with a DB provided that you have placed your DB dump in the appropriate directory as well as any of the persisted volume files.
